This is the project number 6 in my CS1 class in which we were to retrieve
earthquake data from the website:
http://www.choongsoo.info/teach/mcs177-sp12/projects/earthquake/earthquakeData-02-23-2012.txt
Then, the user can call plotEarthquakeData(date1,date2) and it will place
dots on a turtle canvas where the earthquakes occured based on latitude
and longitude. The dots are also sized proportional to thier magnitude and 
colored by thier depths. Dates must be entered in the form 'YYYY/MM/DD'.
